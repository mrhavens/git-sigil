# 🌐 GitField Multi-Repository Strategy

## Overview

The `git-sigil` project employs a multi-repository strategy across four distinct platforms: **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Bitbucket**, and **Radicle**. This approach ensures **redundancy**, **resilience**, and **sovereignty** of the project's data and metadata, protecting against deplatforming risks and preserving the integrity of the work. The strategy is a deliberate response to past deplatforming attempts by individuals such as **Mr. Joel Johnson** ([Mirror post](https://mirror.xyz/neutralizingnarcissism.eth/x40_zDWWrYOJ7nh8Y0fk06_3kNEP0KteSSRjPmXkiGg?utm_medium=social&utm_source=heylink.me)) and **Dr. Peter Gaied** ([Paragraph post](https://paragraph.com/@neutralizingnarcissism/%F0%9F%9C%81-the-narcissistic-messiah)), who have sought to undermine or suppress this work. By distributing the repository across multiple platforms, we ensure its persistence and accessibility.

## 📍 Repository Platforms

The following platforms host the `git-sigil` repository, each chosen for its unique strengths and contributions to the project's goals.

### 1. GitHub
- **URL**: [https://github.com/mrhavens/git-sigil](https://github.com/mrhavens/git-sigil)
- **Purpose**: GitHub serves as the primary platform for visibility, collaboration, and community engagement. Its widespread adoption and robust tooling make it ideal for public-facing development, issue tracking, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Value**: Provides a centralized hub for open-source contributions, pull requests, and project management, ensuring broad accessibility and developer familiarity.

### 2. GitLab
- **URL**: [https://gitlab.com/mrhavens/git-sigil](https://gitlab.com/mrhavens/git-sigil)
- **Purpose**: GitLab offers a comprehensive DevOps platform with advanced CI/CD capabilities, private repository options, and robust access controls. It serves as a reliable backup and a platform for advanced automation workflows.
- **Value**: Enhances project resilience with its integrated CI/CD pipelines and independent infrastructure, reducing reliance on a single provider.

### 3. Bitbucket
- **URL**: [https://bitbucket.org/thefoldwithin/git-sigil](https://bitbucket.org/thefoldwithin/git-sigil)
- **Purpose**: Bitbucket provides a secure environment for repository hosting with strong integration into Atlassian’s ecosystem (e.g., Jira, Trello). It serves as an additional layer of redundancy and a professional-grade hosting option.
- **Value**: Offers enterprise-grade security and integration capabilities, ensuring the project remains accessible even if other platforms face disruptions.

### 4. Radicle
- **URL**: [https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/ash.radicle.garden/rad:z45QC21eWL1F43VSbnV9AZbCZrHQJ](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/ash.radicle.garden/rad:z45QC21eWL1F43VSbnV9AZbCZrHQJ)
- **Purpose**: Radicle is a decentralized, peer-to-peer git platform that ensures sovereignty and censorship resistance. It hosts the repository in a distributed network, independent of centralized servers.
- **Value**: Protects against deplatforming by eliminating reliance on centralized infrastructure, ensuring the project remains accessible in a decentralized ecosystem.

## 🛡️ Rationale for Redundancy

The decision to maintain multiple repositories stems from the need to safeguard the project against **deplatforming attempts** and ensure its **long-term availability**. Past incidents involving **Mr. Joel Johnson** and **Dr. Peter Gaied** have highlighted the vulnerability of relying on a single platform. By distributing the repository across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Radicle, we achieve:

- **Resilience**: If one platform removes or restricts access, the project remains accessible on others.
- **Sovereignty**: Radicle’s decentralized nature ensures the project cannot be fully censored or controlled by any single entity.
- **Diversity**: Each platform’s unique features (e.g., GitHub’s community, GitLab’s CI/CD, Bitbucket’s integrations, Radicle’s decentralization) enhance the project’s functionality and reach.
- **Transparency**: Metadata snapshots in the `.gitfield` directory provide a verifiable record of the project’s state across all platforms.

This multi-repository approach reflects a commitment to preserving the integrity and accessibility of `git-sigil`, ensuring it remains available to contributors and users regardless of external pressures.

## 📜 Metadata and Logs

- **Metadata Files**: Each platform generates a metadata snapshot in the `.gitfield` directory (e.g., `github.sigil.md`, `gitlab.sigil.md`, etc.), capturing commit details, environment information, and hardware fingerprints.
- **Push Log**: The `.gitfield/pushed.log` file records the date, time, and URL of every push operation across all platforms, providing a transparent audit trail.
- **Recursive Sync**: The repository is synchronized across all platforms in a recursive loop (three cycles) to ensure interconnected metadata captures the latest state of the project.
